            We conducted a heritage audit on the hotel windows with a view of returning them back to
            their original state. Additionally, we conducted a safety audit, brought the site up to
            standard, and constructed shelters to protect the building.

            We restored the windows, doors, skirting, architraves and trim, reproducing any that
            were missing or couldnâ€™t be salvaged.

            We installed a mantlepiece, replaced skirting boards, trim and aluminium windows with
            timber reproductions that were as closely matched to the originals as we could ascertain
            from inspecting the building, old photographs and consulting with heritage architects.

            We managed the third and final stage of restoration, which included the replacement of
            ornate stonework, leadwork and carpentry. This was a very rewarding state heritage
            project to be involved in.
